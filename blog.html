            <p class="blog-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been fascinated by programming ever since I've been little and my passion 
                only keeps on growing. I love solving problems that occur in my projects, as well as thinking of ways to make my ideas come to 
                reality. After graduation I want to become a front-end developer and make tailor made websites for customers that would help them
                and make their lives easier.

            <h1 class="color">Programming experience</h1>

            <p class="blog-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About four years ago I thought of exploring different areas of programming. 
                I decided to develop my first video game that my friends could download and enjoy playing. 
                The game is called “Fun Run” and the concept is to make the character jump over obstacles. Later, In September 2020 I completed 
                my first major programming project called “WordQuiz”. The main objective of this website is to help users learn new 
                words by making a list of them and then having to answer. Seeking to further develop my IT skills, I took the “HTML, CSS, 
                and Javascript for Web Developers” online course by Johns Hopkins University and earned a certificate.
