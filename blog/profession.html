            I've been particulary interested in the work that Facebook does. It is a social media website that allows users to connect with people
            from anywhere in the world. On Facebook users can share pictures, music, videos and their opinions about hot topics. In Facebook they
            offer a lot of different IT roles, like engineer, developer, consultant and manager. Facebook has large code bases in C++, Java, and PHP, 
            and smaller amounts of code in languages such as C, Erlang, OCaml, and Python. The atmosphere of the company is very loose and casual, and 
            it's an environment that well-suits extroverts. I love that the environment is highly motivating and promotes personal and professional growth. 
            Also that Facebook greatly values and rewards excellence and hard work.
