        <p class="blog-content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been fascinated by programming ever since I've been little and my passion 
            only keeps on growing. I love solving problems that occur in my projects, as well as thinking of ways to make my ideas come to 
            reality. After graduation I want to become a front-end developer and make tailor made websites for customers that would help them
            and make their lives easier.
